sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field 

Riding high, when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, but you warned me then
But easy come, and easy go, and it would end

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again
